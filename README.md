# Expo CLI: Uncommon Startup or Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Expo CLI. The error message is often vague and does not pinpoint the root cause effectively. This example showcases a potential scenario and its resolution.

## Problem

The project fails to start or build, displaying a cryptic error message in the terminal.  The error might relate to a dependency conflict, an issue in `app.json`/`expo.json`, or an incompatibility with the Expo CLI version. 

## Solution

The solution involves troubleshooting several potential causes, including:

* **Checking Expo CLI version:** Ensure compatibility with the React Native version in your project.
* **Inspecting `app.json` / `expo.json`:** Verify the configuration for potential errors.
* **Reviewing dependencies:** Look for conflicts or outdated packages.  Consider cleaning your node modules (`npm cache clean --force && npm install`) and re-installing dependencies.
* **Updating Expo CLI:** Use `expo upgrade` or reinstall to use the latest version. 

This example uses a specific case, and the solution might need adaptation based on the error message.
