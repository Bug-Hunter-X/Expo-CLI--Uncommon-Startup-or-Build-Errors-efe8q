This error typically occurs when you're using an older version of Expo CLI or when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI and the version of React Native in your project.  Another cause can be incorrect configurations within your `app.json` or `expo.json` file, or even issues with your project's dependencies.  It's not always immediately obvious what's causing it.
